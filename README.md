## Exercise - Selecting DOM elements

This is an exercise in finding elements on the page (in the DOM).

Your task is to write javascript, in the console, to retrieve the objects which represent these elements.

Start with these:

1. Select the `<body>`
- Select the `<header>`
- Select all of the elements with class .quote
- Select all of the subject elements
- Select the navigation links
- Select all the quotes in the "life" section.
- Using relative selection, select the `<p>` element containing the second Mark Twain quote
- Do the same using a query selector
- Select the 'Quotes About Motivation' heading

Next:

Once you find those, pick various items on the page and retrieve their objects.

### Bonus
 Using the console, add the author's last name, as a class, to one of the quotes.
